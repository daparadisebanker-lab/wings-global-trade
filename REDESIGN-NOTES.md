# REDESIGN-NOTES.md — TOWER macOS Shell migration

Visual/decision log for the TOWER-REDESIGN.md migration, merged with the
IA/UX “Path to 100” plan. One section per phase. Newest first.

Ratified direction (2026-07-22): **Option C — full adoption, law updated
ecosystem-wide** (see `DECISIONS.md` → “macOS material adoption”, and the
amendments to root `CLAUDE.md` §1.6 and §2). Additive only: wrap, don’t
rewrite; zero feature regression.

## P2b — Nightwatch (dark) + theme toggle  ·  status: built, PREVIEW-only (not prod)

The first big *visible* change. Deployed to preview and reviewed BEFORE production
(the user-agreed exception to the auto-deploy loop).

**What landed**
- `globals.css` — full `[data-app='tower'][data-theme='dark']` re-point of the core
  livery (`--surface-0/1/2`, `--ink-primary/secondary`, `--line`, `--accent/accent-ink`,
  `--gold/gold-ink`, `--positive/negative`, `--stamp`, `--scrim`) PLUS explicit dark
  values for the premium/tile set (`--premium-ground/chrome`, the three
  `--premium-*-shadow`, `--premium-tile`, `--tile-ink(-muted)`, `--tile-positive/negative`)
  — never composed, because they mix from `--ink-primary` which is now light and
  would invert. `color-scheme: dark`.
- `components/shell/ThemeToggle.tsx` + mounted in TopBar (right cluster). Writes the
  `tower-theme` key (P1 bootstrap contract); flips `data-theme` instantly; renders
  after mount (no hydration mismatch); `aria-pressed` + labeled + gold focus ring.
- Document/print exemption: verified by grep that the document CSS
  (proforma/quote/ficha/cost-sheet/rb) uses ZERO livery color tokens — they are
  self-scoped hardcoded light palettes, so dark cannot reach them. Added defensive
  `color-scheme: light` on the document page frames.

**Design decision — inverted primary.** As in light (where `--accent == --ink-primary`
= navy), dark keeps them equal (`#f5f5f7`): a primary button is a light fill with
dark ink. High-contrast, macOS-appropriate; the gold jewel carries brand colour.

**Deferrals (logged, deliberate):**
- **OS-preference auto-dark deferred to P5.** The bootstrap stays explicit-only
  (no `prefers-color-scheme` fallback yet). Reason: the toggle is desktop-only in
  P2b (per the reviewer, mobile waits for the P5 Control Center) — so if OS-dark
  auto-applied, a dark-OS mobile user would be stuck with no way out. Dark must be
  escapable everywhere before it can be automatic. P5 mounts the mobile toggle AND
  turns on the OS fallback together.
- Mobile toggle → P5 Control Center quick-status row.

**Contrast spot-check (WCAG AA; full matrix pending on preview):**
`ink-primary #f5f5f7` on `surface-0 #1c1c1e` ≈ 15:1 ✓ · `ink-secondary #9a9aa2` on
`surface-0` ≈ 6.2:1 ✓ · `gold #e0b866` on `surface-0` ≈ 9.6:1 ✓ (emphasis/large) ·
`accent-ink #17171a` on `accent #f5f5f7` ≈ 16:1 ✓ · `gold-ink #1a1c1f` on `gold` ≈ 9:1 ✓.
PENDING on preview: every LaneSwitcher lane-accent against dark surfaces; `/login`
hero+scrim legibility in dark; positive/negative chips on dark rows; the full
375/768/1440 × both-theme × (table · board · form · document · /login) matrix.

**Review fixes (Fable P2b: APPROVE-WITH-FIXES; both sequencing calls accepted):**
- F-P2b-1 (applied) — dark `--negative` lifted `#e0564a → #ec7b72`: the old value
  passed on `surface-0` but FAILED AA (~3.8:1) on `surface-1/2`, where negative
  text (failed QC, expired, negative deltas) actually renders. Now ≈5.2:1 on
  surface-1. `--tile-negative` re-derives (var-based).
- F-P2b-2 (applied) — doc `color-scheme: light` selector corrected
  `.rbqdoc-annex → .rbqdoc-page` (the actual marcas-cotización page frame).
- F-P2b-3 (applied) — ThemeToggle renders an invisible same-footprint placeholder
  pre-mount instead of `null`, so the TopBar cluster doesn't shift on hydration.
- Coverage-ledger exemption: `--texture` (value `none`, colorless) has no dark
  counterpart — nothing to re-point. `--lane-accent` auto-re-points via
  `var(--accent)`; per-lane inline accents parked in the preview QA matrix.

**Why preview-only:** dark is now reachable on a live app. Holding production until
the preview QA matrix + user review pass (F-P2a-2 scroll check rides along).

## P2a — Shell frame (page transition + greeting bar)  ·  status: built, in review

Frame only — NO theme toggle (the reviewer's P2a/P2b split; the toggle + full
dark re-points ship as P2b).

**What landed**
- `apps/tower/src/shell/frame/GreetingBar.tsx` — a slim top strip: time-of-day
  greeting + today's date (es-PE) + operator identity (`userEmail`). Real data
  only; time-sensitive values computed after mount (neutral "Hola" + no date on
  SSR/first paint) so there is no hydration mismatch.
- `globals.css` — `--duration-page: 200ms` token + `.mac-page` page-transition
  (200ms fade + `translateY(8→0)`, transform+opacity only). Reduced-motion
  redefines the keyframe to opacity-only at 80ms linear.
- `ShellChrome.tsx` — additive wrap: `<GreetingBar>` inserted below TopBar; the
  content `<main>` gains `key={pathname}` + `.mac-page` so the transition replays
  on navigation. The rail, TopBar, Breadcrumb, RouteProgress, OnboardingBanner,
  Mister dock/launcher, drawer a11y machinery — all untouched. NavRail remains
  the working nav until the P4 Dock.

**Deliberate deferrals (logged)**
- **Ground swap deferred.** The macOS `--surface-base` (#F5F5F7) ground is NOT
  applied yet — the content keeps the existing warm-white `--premium-ground`.
  The ground/material adoption lands in the P8 sweep with the material cards, so
  P2a stays additive (only the greeting strip + a subtle page-in animation are
  visible). Avoids flattening the designed premium gradient before it's QA'd.
- No Dock content-padding (96px) — that is P4's job.

**Visible deltas this phase:** a new greeting strip below the top bar **(desktop
only, `md+`)**; a 200ms page-in animation on route change (opacity-only under
reduced-motion).

**Review fixes / notes (Fable P2a: APPROVE-WITH-FIXES):**
- F-P2a-1 (applied) — GreetingBar is `hidden md:flex` (desktop only). Three
  stacked strips would have eaten ~140px of a 390px viewport, undoing the mobile
  work in `f44cde2`. Mobile greeting/identity arrives with the **P5 Control
  Center** quick-status row (spec §3.2), not a persistent mobile strip.
- F-P2a-2 (runtime check, PENDING) — with `<main key={pathname}>` remounting on
  navigation + a 200ms entrance, browser Back/Forward scroll restoration must be
  confirmed on the deployed build (navigate deep into /catalog → open a record →
  Back → scroll restores). Next's scroll restoration should re-apply; verify and
  record here. Not statically verifiable.
- F-P2a-3 (tripwire, no change) — while `.mac-page` animates, `<main>`'s
  `transform` is the containing block for any `position: fixed` descendant.
  Safe TODAY (all fixed UI lives in the shell outside `<main>`; page content uses
  only `sticky`). RULE for P8 + future features: any fixed-position UI rendered
  inside page content must be portaled, or it mispositions for 200ms after each
  navigation.

## P3 — Navigation registry + useActiveTool  ·  status: reviewed (APPROVE-WITH-FIXES), committing

The one source of truth (TOWER-REDESIGN §5, "one registry" DoD gate).

**What landed**
- `apps/tower/src/shell/navigation/registry.ts` — the canonical `TOOLS` array
  (the 11 modules, enriched with ES+EN `keywords`, `section` derived from `group`,
  `order`) PLUS the palette destinations/actions previously hardcoded in
  `CommandPalette` (`SELF_DESTINATIONS`, `ADMIN_DESTINATIONS`, `ADMIN_ACTIONS`, and
  the two disabled placeholders as `EVERYONE_ACTIONS`). `label: Localized`,
  `icon` stays a key (React-free, server-safe data module), plus a pure
  `resolveActiveTool(pathname)`.
- `apps/tower/src/shell/navigation/useActiveTool.ts` — `'use client'` hook, the
  SOLE active-route derivation now (segment-aware: `=== href || startsWith(href+'/')`).
- `lib/nav.ts` — `MODULES` now `= TOOLS` (re-export; zero call-site churn). Types +
  `NAV_GROUPS` stay here (group metadata, migrates to the registry in P4 when the
  Dock consumes `section`).
- Consumers rewired: `NavRail` active state + `ShellChrome` Breadcrumb both read
  `useActiveTool` (the two duplicated `pathname.startsWith` derivations removed);
  `CommandPalette` renders 100% from the registry.

**Review fixes applied (this commit)**
- F-P3-1 — this log entry.
- F-P3-2 — `keywords` wired into the palette `value` strings (modules read
  `TOOLS` directly for the typed field), so ⌘K search benefits now, not in P6.
- F-P3-3 — `adminOnly` is now consumed: the two ungated palette renders
  (`SELF_DESTINATIONS`, `EVERYONE_ACTIONS`) filter on `!adminOnly || isGroupAdmin`,
  so the flag can never be inert booby-trap metadata.

**Gate status:** one canonical source (grep-verified); zero consumer regression
(rail groups/labels/tags/empty-state, rbac `visible` filtering, breadcrumb
`/perfil → null → "TOWER"`, admin gating, disabled placeholders all identical);
no runtime import cycle (nav→registry value, registry→nav type-only). `next build`
NOT run locally (no node_modules) — the P2 commit must run a real build/CI.

**Next:** P2 (shell frame) — content surface + page-transition wrapper + greeting
bar, wrapping ShellChrome. Split recommended by review: P2a = frame, NO theme
toggle; P2b = full dark re-points of the core livery tokens + toggle + QA at
375/768/1440. A toggle with partial dark coverage will be BLOCKED.

## P1-fix — Fable review corrections + ratified decisions  ·  folded into the P3 commit

Fable pre-commit reviewer verdict on P1 (`cb045fe`): **APPROVE-WITH-FIXES**.
Corrections applied:
- **F1** — `.material-chrome` now leads with an opaque `var(--surface-raised)`
  fallback before the `color-mix` translucency (old engines drop color-mix AND
  backdrop-filter together, which would have left chrome fully transparent). The
  dead `@supports` block removed.
- **F4** — Tailwind key `'ease-exit'` → `'exit'` (the namespace prefixes `ease-`;
  the old key generated `ease-ease-exit`).
- **F5** — reduced-motion `.mac-motion` block now also zeroes `transition-delay`
  / `animation-delay` (so the P4 Dock tooltip's 400ms delay collapses too).
- Added `--duration-snappy/settle/exit` tokens (300/450/180ms) so P4 shell files
  never inline motion-duration literals.

Ratified decisions (logging, per guardrail §9):
- **F2 · ink-collision strategy — DECISION: Wings navy IS TOWER's Daylight ink.**
  We do NOT adopt spec §2.1's `--ink-primary #1D1D1F` / `--ink-secondary #6E6E73`;
  TOWER keeps its brand navy `#001E50` / `#5B6578` as the light-theme ink (guardrail
  §9 — codebase/brand conventions win over spec values). Consequence: the macOS
  layer ships NO ink tokens; new surfaces use the existing `text-ink-primary`.
  Nightwatch (dark) ink/surface/line re-points (`--ink-primary #F5F5F7`, etc.) ship
  in the SAME commit that mounts the theme toggle (P2) — never before — so dark is
  complete when first reachable. The P2 review BLOCKS a mounted toggle without full
  dark coverage.
- **F3 · accepted visual delta** — `text-ink-tertiary` was a latent no-op pre-P1;
  activating it changes the missing-client "—" placeholder in
  `QuotationsWindow.tsx` from inherited navy to `#AEAEB2`. Decorative, almost
  certainly the original author's intent; accepted and logged so the regression
  trail stays honest ("zero visible change" holds except this one cell).
- **Log-only ratifications:** dark `--elevation-1..4` (strengthened shadows) are an
  additive invention, not in spec §2 — ratified. Spec §2.6 SF type stacks
  deliberately NOT adopted (TOWER keeps Flexo/NissanOpti/Teko). Stale comment at
  `globals.css` (“the one deliberate departure from the no-gradients refusal”) is
  now inaccurate post-amendment — swept in P8.

## P1 — Token layer + theme plumbing  ·  status: SHIPPED to branch (preview)

**What landed**
- `apps/tower/src/app/globals.css` — the macOS token set added as a **new,
  additive layer** (no existing livery token redefined, so the live app is
  visually unchanged):
  - Color: `--surface-base/raised/sunken`, `--ink-tertiary`,
    `--accent-wings(+hover)`, `--signal-positive/negative/caution`,
    `--line-hairline` — Daylight (light) defaults + a Nightwatch block under
    `[data-app='tower'][data-theme='dark']`.
  - Elevation `--elevation-1..4`; radius `--radius-control/card-lg/panel/dock/pill`;
    spring motion `--spring-snappy/settle`, `--ease-exit`.
  - Materials `.material-chrome / .material-panel / .material-scrim` with a
    `@supports` fallback for no-`backdrop-filter` browsers; reduced-motion
    collapses `.mac-motion` to an 80ms fade.
- `apps/tower/tailwind.config.ts` — new tokens exposed as utilities
  (`bg-surface-base`, `text-ink-tertiary`, `rounded-control/card-lg/panel/dock/pill`,
  `shadow-elevation-*`, `ease-spring-*`). Legacy `rounded-card` (4px) untouched.
- `apps/tower/src/app/layout.tsx` — no-FOUC bootstrap script applies a persisted
  `data-theme` before paint; `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`.

**Deliberate deferrals (safety, pre-QA)**
- **No theme toggle mounted yet.** A control that themes nothing would be a dead
  affordance (the exact anti-pattern the audit flagged). The toggle lands in P2
  with the first macOS shell surface.
- **Dark defaults OFF.** The bootstrap goes dark only on an explicit stored
  choice — never from OS preference yet — so no half-built dark reaches live
  users. “Honor OS on first load” switches on once the component sweep (P8)
  makes dark complete.
- **Colliding names kept safe.** `--radius-card` stays 4px; the macOS 12px card
  radius is `--radius-card-lg` until the sweep migrates usages.
- **Existing surface/ink/line tokens not re-pointed for dark** — that happens in
  the sweep wave, with visual QA at 375 / 768 / 1440.

**Gate check:** additive; no existing token changed; preview build green. The
next phase can consume these tokens on new surfaces in both themes.

**Next:** P3 navigation registry (`src/shell/navigation/registry.ts` +
`useActiveTool`) and P2 shell frame, then the Dock (P4) / Control Center (P5).
