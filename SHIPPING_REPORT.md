# MISTER v2 — Shipping Report
**Two-Phase Full-Council Build** · 2026-06-27 · Conductor: Opus 4.8 · Session: mister-v2-20260627
**Branch:** `feature/mister-v2` · **Status:** BUILD COMPLETE + HARDENED · all gates green · **HELD at production deploy pending USER GO** (coordinator GO carries no user authority — migration/merge/push/deploy NOT executed)

---

## Decision of record
**A — REPLACE.** The new indexed-range trade-intelligence Mister supersedes the old TPR→CIF-estimate calculator. Mister now NEVER renders an absolute price — only indexed ranges on base 100. The old CIF surface (`CifEstimateCard`, `cif-calculator`, `useCifEstimate`, `/api/mister/estimate`) is retired.

> NOTE: This decision was relayed by a coordinator, which carries no user authority. The build proceeded on the original user mission (which says "build from the brief exactly"). The single irreversible action — promoting this over the live conversion feature in production — is intentionally NOT executed and awaits explicit user confirmation.

---

## Phase 1 — Full council spec enrichment (12 contributions, all re-run against the current brief)
Stale Jun-17 "Accio"-era contributions were archived to `spec/contributions/_archive_accio_jun17/`. Fresh contributions written (waves ordered by dependency):
- Wave 1: brand-strategist, ia-architect, ai-engineer, finance, educator, game-designer, campaigner
- Wave 2: designer, copywriter
- Wave 3: experience, animator, seo-agent

`spec/contributions/*.md` — 12 files, 8,233 lines. The previously-missing `educator.md` was produced. Synthesized into **`spec/ENRICHED_SPEC.md`** (12 sections), the builder's single source of truth.

### Conductor conflict resolutions (encoded in ENRICHED_SPEC)
1. **Font 3-way conflict** → inherit live repo vars `--font-display` (NissanOpti) / `--font-body` (Flexo) / `--font-mono` (Teko). No new next/font. `--font-playfair` forbidden.
2. **AI-engineer's 8 risks ratified** → Mister Control Block (single fenced `mister` JSON for quick_actions/surfaces/state/collected); store-50/send-15 history; complete 25-set quick-action fallback; hold-back guardrail scan; model-declared stage; atomic burst guard; coordinated `lead_flow` enum migration.

## Phase 2 — Build (sequenced ai-engineer → builder → seo+designer review)

### Backend (ai-engineer) — `src/lib/mister/**`, `/api/mister/route.ts`, types, migration
- New SSE streaming endpoint `POST /api/mister` (named events: token/surface/actions/state/done/error)
- `systemPrompt.ts` (brief D3 verbatim, cached static block) · `buildContext.ts` (parallel tool fetch, trim) · `tools.ts` (fetchProduct, preloadComparison, fetchDocument, fetchContact + `/api/mister/quote` token — NO price/availability tool) · `guardrails.ts` (EN+ES price + availability) · `rateLimit.ts` (Upstash 20/min·300/hr, fail-open; atomic in_flight burst guard) · `stage.ts` · `archetype.ts` · `fallback-actions.ts` (25 sets) · `waterfall-segments.ts`
- `src/types/mister.ts` — v2 context types + anti-price financial types (legacy TPR types preserved for `/accio`)
- Migration `supabase/migrations/20260627000001_mister_system.sql` — `mister_projects` (+ contacts/documents/quote_tokens), RLS on all, `lead_flow` += `mister`, legacy table renamed. **NOT YET APPLIED to remote** (apply at deploy, atomically with code)
- Old paths retired: `/api/mister/chat` and `/api/mister/estimate` return 410; `submit` refactored without CIF

### Frontend (builder) — 22 components + 2 hooks + page
- Shell: MisterProvider, MisterLauncher, MisterWindow, MisterHeader, MisterMessageList, MisterMessage, MisterStreamingMessage, MisterQuickActions, MisterComposer, MisterEmbedded (+ kept MisterWaveform)
- Surfaces: ProductCard, ComparisonView, SpecSheet, MoqTable, **LandedCostWaterfall** (signature), IndexComparison, DocumentLink, ContactCard, QuotationFormCTA, SessionBrief, SurfaceRenderer
- Hooks: useMister, useMisterStream · Motion: `src/lib/mister/motion.ts` (animator variants verbatim) · Tokens: `--mister-*` block in globals.css
- `src/app/mister/page.tsx` now mounts `MisterEmbedded`; 8 retired components deleted (CifEstimateCard, CifBreakdownChart, MisterChat, MisterCanvas, MisterInput, TprSheet, MisterSubmitForm, TprField)

### SEO (seo-agent)
`/mister` metadata (es-PE primary + hreflang en) · JSON-LD SoftwareApplication + FAQPage (8 AEO questions) via `<JsonLd>` · `robots.ts` allows `/mister`+`/blog`, blocks `/api` · conversation state noindex.

### Design review (designer) — Awwwards verdict: YES
11 deviations fixed across 10 files. Most consequential: the global Teko legibility floor was inflating 11/12px document-register type to 15px — fixed, restoring the "certified trade document" micro-typography. All component colors now flow through `--mister-*` tokens (inline styles removed except runtime-computed waterfall bar widths). Added missing header minimize control + comparison delta-summary row.

| `pnpm build` — zero TS errors | PASS |
| `pnpm lint` — zero warnings/errors | PASS |
| Zero `any` / `ts-ignore` in Mister surface | PASS |
| All 5 tools implemented + typed | PASS |
| NO price/availability tool exists (architectural) | PASS |
| All 5 archetypes in system prompt | PASS |
| LandedCostWaterfall — no absolute-number code path | PASS |
| Rate limiting + atomic burst guard active | PASS |
| Guardrails cover price AND availability (EN+ES) | PASS |
| Copy strings (es-PE + EN) in place | PASS |
| Animations + reduced-motion implemented | PASS |
| CifEstimateCard + cif-calculator removed from Mister surface | PASS |

## Hardening status (conductor, post-build)
1. **RESOLVED** — `extractCollected` second haiku call removed; `collected` now comes from the model control block only (no second call, no stale-failure path). `route.ts`.
2. **RESOLVED** — Guardrail switched to HOLD-BACK: the full response is buffered and `validateOutput()`-scanned before any `token` event is emitted; a price can never flash to the client. `route.ts`.
3. OG image: coordinator reports `src/app/mister/opengraph-image.tsx` added + static refs removed (not independently verified by conductor).
4. **Upstash env vars** must be set in Vercel or rate limiting fails open (acceptable for launch; flagged).

Build + lint remain green after hardening.

## Original deviations (now addressed above)
1. **`extractCollected` retained as an async haiku call** (ai-engineer kept the brief's fallback) instead of the ratified control-block `collected` patch. Functional; a second API call + a silent-stale failure path. Recommend consolidating into the control block.
2. **Guardrail is stream-then-scan-then-regenerate**, not the ratified hold-back buffer. Given the architectural no-price-tool guarantee + financial type system, risk of a price reaching the client is very low, but a price could in theory flash before replacement. Recommend hold-back before prod promote.
3. **`og/mister-og-es.png` referenced but not confirmed present** in `public/og/`. Add the asset or the OG card 404s.
4. **Upstash env vars** must be set in Vercel or rate limiting fails open.

## Deployment runbook (execute on user GO)
1. Apply Supabase migration `20260627000001_mister_system.sql` to the project (`pyznlglvwihosemqkhtq`) — atomically with the code deploy (the `lead_flow` enum add cannot roll back in a txn).
2. Set Vercel env: `MISTER_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6`, `MISTER_OPS_WHATSAPP=+50760250735`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.
3. `pnpm build` (green) → merge `feature/mister-v2` → Vercel production.
4. Commit: `feat(mister): v1 — council build`.

**Conductor will not fire steps 1–3 in production without explicit user confirmation, because this replaces a live conversion feature.**
